A reliable baseline performance for this topic classification problem is given by a Max Entropy classifier which assumes independence over subsequent topics. However, the reviews exhibit an inherent structure on the document level allowing to frame the task as sequence classification problem. Since more flexible models from the class of Conditional Random Fields were not competitive because of the limited amount of training data available, we propose using a Hidden Markov Model instead and decouple the training of transition and emission probabilities. The discriminating power of the Max Entropy approach is used for the latter. Besides outperforming both standalone methods as well as more generic models such as linear-chain Conditional Random Fields, the combined classifier is able to assign topics on subsentence level although labeling in the training data is only available on sentence level.\nArticle Abstract\n","date":1568811600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566133200,"objectID":"b6b7ba6fa53a0d1bd338e9e2c87d38ca","permalink":"https://cornelia-ferner.github.io/post/2019_ecmlpkdd/","publishdate":"2019-09-18T14:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019_ecmlpkdd/","section":"post","summary":"Presentation at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD)","tags":["data science","natural language processing","machine learning"],"title":"Paper Presentation: Sub-sentence Level Topic Classification","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["talk"],"content":"","date":1568811600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568811600,"objectID":"e1935cab8d855951ddab1bd3f7a88c8a","permalink":"https://cornelia-ferner.github.io/talk/ecmlpkdd19/","publishdate":"2020-11-23T19:59:42+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ecmlpkdd19/","section":"talk","summary":"Conference Talk for my accepted paper *A Semi-discriminative Approach for Sub-sentence Level Topic Classification on a Small Dataset*.","tags":[],"title":"Sub-sentence Level Topic Classification","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Cornelia Ferner","Günther Eibl","Andreas Unterweger","Sebastian Burkhart","Stefan Wegenkittl"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"8a06e7fde2ec97d4659c0c73e772bbb3","permalink":"https://cornelia-ferner.github.io/publication/ferner19a/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T18:43:21+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ferner19a/","section":"publication","summary":"The nationwide rollout of smart meters in private households raises privacy concerns: Is it possible to extract privacy-sensitive information from a household’s power consumption? For a small sample of 869 Upper Austrian households, information about consumption-heavy amenities and household characteristics are available. This work studies the detection of households with swimming pools (the most common amenity in the dataset) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied on load heatmaps constructed from load profiles. Although only a small dataset is available, results show that by using CNNs, privacy can be broken automatically, i.e., without the time-consuming, manual feature generation. The method even slightly outperforms a previous approach that relies on a nearest neighbor classifier with engineered features.","tags":["deep learning","small data","energy informatics"],"title":"Pool Detection from Smart Metering Data with Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valeriya Azarova","Dominik Engel","Cornelia Ferner","Andrea Kollmann","Johannes Reichl"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519862400,"objectID":"29785dd29cfa2678c33deebdf21dd255","permalink":"https://cornelia-ferner.github.io/publication/azarova18a/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T19:07:35+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/azarova18a/","section":"publication","summary":"Growing self-generation and storage are expected to cause significant changes in residential electricity utilization patterns. Commonly applied volumetric network tariffs may induce imbalance between different groups of households and their respective contribution to recovering the operating costs of the grid. Understanding consumer behaviour and appliance usage together with socio-economic factors can help regulatory authorities to adapt network tariffs to new circumstances in a fair way. Here, we assess the effects of 11 network tariff scenarios on household budgets using real load profiles from 765 households. Thus we explore the possibly disruptive impact of applying peak-load-based tariffs on the budgets of households when they have been mainly charged for consumed volumes before. Our analysis estimates the change in household network expenditure for different combinations of energy, peak and fixed charges, and can help to design tariffs that recover the costs needed for the sustainable operation of the grid.","tags":["data science","energy informatics"],"title":"Exploring the impact of network tariffs on household electricity expenditures using load profiles and socio-economic characteristics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cornelia Ferner","Werner Pomwenger","Stefan Wegenkittl","Martin Schnöll","Veronika Haaf","Arnold Keller"],"categories":["natural language processing","research"],"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"73450687e318cdbb50bcce034e110e92","permalink":"https://cornelia-ferner.github.io/publication/ferner17a/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T19:13:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ferner17a/","section":"publication","summary":"Produktbewertungen sind eine wertvolle Informationsquelle sowohl für Unternehmen als auch für Kunden.

This results in new use cases which can be implemented based on business process technology. Understanding and automating business processes requires to model and test them. However, existing process testing approaches frequently struggle with the testing of process resources, such as ERP systems, and negative testing. Hence, this work presents a toolchain which tackles that limitations. The approach uses an open source process engine to generate event logs and applies process mining techniques in a novel way.","tags":["energy informatics"],"title":"Application and Testing of Business Processes in the Energy Domain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cornelia Ferner","Glenn Wagner","Howie Choset"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":1370044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1370044800,"objectID":"0a3030a2192222aecb73dd1f792410d1","permalink":"https://cornelia-ferner.github.io/publication/ferner13a/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T19:13:27+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ferner13a/","section":"publication","summary":"We believe the core of handling the complexity of coordinated multiagent search lies in identifying which subsets of robots can be safely decoupled, and hence planned for in a lower dimensional space. Our work, as well as those of others take that perspective. In our prior work, we introduced an approach called subdimensional expansion for constructing low-dimensional but sufficient search spaces for multirobot path planning, and an implementation for graph search called M*. Subdimensional expansion dynamically increases the dimensionality of the search space in regions featuring significant robot-robot interactions. In this paper, we integrate M* with Meta-Agent Constraint-Based Search (MA-CBS), a planning framework that seeks to couple repeatedly colliding robots allowing for other robots to be planned in low-dimensional search space. M* is also integrated with operator decomposition (OD), an A*-variant performing lazy search of the outneighbors of a given vertex. We show that the combined algorithm demonstrates state of the art performance.","tags":["multi-agent systems"],"title":"ODrM* optimal multirobot path planning in low dimensional search spaces","type":"publication"}]
