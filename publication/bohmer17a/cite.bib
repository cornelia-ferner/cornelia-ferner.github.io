        abstract = {The energy domain currently struggles with radical legal and technological changes, such as, smart meters. This results in new use cases which can be implemented based on business process technology. Understanding and automating business processes requires to model and test them. However, existing process testing approaches frequently struggle with the  testing of process resources, such as ERP systems, and negative testing. Hence, this work presents a toolchain which tackles that limitations. The approach uses an open source process engine to generate event logs and applies process mining techniques in a novel way.}
