	abstract="The potential of data analytics and modeling, especially in the context of digital transformation, is well known and seen as an opportunity to increase competitiveness and innovation in companies. However, the technical and organizational implementation of these methods poses challenges specifically for SMEs. A regional multi-case study explores the causes and exhibits patterns that suggest differentiated recommendations for action. Awareness of the diverse limitations and challenges can help all players involved -- companies, universities and governmental organizations -- to design future projects in an even more targeted manner."
